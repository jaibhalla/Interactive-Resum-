# Interactive Resume
A concept idea created to make the job hunting experience a little less boring.         

This is not my actual resum√© but I have used the achievements of the following people as homage for the inspiration their work gave me: 

Robby Leonardi.        
Anshuman Dhar.        
Gary Sheng.  
Andrew McCarthy.  

## Somethings Cool
1. Arcade theme with changing colors 
2. There were three different versions of this idea:

### Linear Flow
Follow a set story of pages by eating one nibble at a time. 
### Parallel Flow
Many foods all at once: Eat a bite and get a page.
### Game Flow
This is the Final Version. Progress Bar and Options for difficulty and page viewership were added too
